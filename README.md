The Complete Works of Shrikar!

This is a bunch of random stuff that I've created over the years. Some of it is cool; some of it is obscure bullshit that doesn't do anything but is cool in its own way.

I haven't uploaded any of this to GitHub until now because these are (for the most part) simulators, scrapers and other random experiments and data analyzers that I created to satiate my own fleeting curiosities. As such, they're not very useful to anyone other than myself, are poorly documented, and aren't particularly well-written.

However, considering that 1) my GitHub page is woefully empty, 2) I've been meaning to find a new home for my code that's not my local machine, and 3) I want to start journalling my life on the internet, I'm finally letting this stuff see the light of day.
