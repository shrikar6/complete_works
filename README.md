The Complete Works of Shrikar!

This is a bunch of random stuff that I've created over the years, some of it's cool, some of it's obscure bullshit that doesn't do anything but is also cool in its own way.

I haven't uploaded any of this to GitHub until now because these are (for the most part) simulators, scrapers and other random experiments and data analyzers that I created to satiate my own transient curiosities. As such, they're of little to no use to anyone other than myself, they're not well-documented, and they're not particularly well-written.

However, considering that 1) my GitHub page is woefully empty, 2) I've been meaning to find a new home for my code that's not my local machine, and 3) I want to start journalling my life on the internet, I'm finally uploading this mess.
